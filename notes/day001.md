# Day 1: variables, simple data types, and string interpolation

# Variables

Variables are used to store program data. The values can vary which is why they are called variables. To declare a variable, use the keyword `var` and then the name to call the variable later in the program. The next step is optional which is to assign a value.

## Example

```swift
var name = "Maegan"
```

The example above declares the variable name and gives it a default value of "Maegan". This can then be changed later by assigning another value to name like below.

```swift
name = "Thorgi"
```

When changing the value of a declared variable, do not use `var` again. `var` is **ONLY** used when declaring the variable.

# Simple Data Types

Data types matter since Swift is a type safe language. This means that each variable has one type associated with it. A variable's type will be determined by the type of the value assigned to it. `name` is a String, which holds letters. There are also other types like Integers that hold whole numbers.

## Example

```swift
var age = 24
```

`age` is an Integer since 24 was assigned to it.
