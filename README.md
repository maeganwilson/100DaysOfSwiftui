## 1. Variables, Simple Data Types, and String interpolation

**Date: Jan 2, 2021**

Using Swift Playgrounds, which is my first real time to jump into Swift Playgrounds.

### Variables

Declare variables with `var`
Variables only need to be declared once and the value can be changed just by using the name

```swift
var str = "Hello, playground" // -> Hello, playground
str = "Goodbye" // -> Goodbye
```
